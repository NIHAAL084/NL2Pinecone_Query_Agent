The victory extended their winning streak to six matches as they climbed to the top of the points table.Listen to StoryLive TVShareJasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya (AP Photo)Rishabh BeniwalNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 23:36 ISTIn ShortMumbai Indians scored 217/2 in 20 overs batting firstRajasthan Royals got bundled out for 117 in 16.1 oversMumbai Indians extended their winning streak to seven matchesMumbai Indians (MI) have made a roaring comeback in the Indian Premier League 2025 (IPL 2025) as they extended their winning streak to six matches with a 100-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR). The Hardik Pandya-led side played at its dominating best, crushing Rajasthan on Thursday, May 1, at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, to knock them out of the competition.The victory also helped MI end their 12-year winning drought in Jaipur, with their last victory at the venue coming way back in 2013. A hapless Rajasthan batting line-up could only score 117 in 16.1 overs chasing a massive target of 218, with Jofra Archer top scoring with 30 (27). Following their commanding victory, Mumbai climbed to the top of the points table with seven wins from 11 matches, having 14 points to their name.On the other hand, Rajasthan maintained eighth spot, with three wins from ten matches, having six points. It has been a remarkable comeback for Mumbai, who won just one out of the first five matches.A ruthless bowling displayDefending a massive score, the potent bowling attack of Mumbai was hungry to pounce on Rajasthan. The carnage with the ball began on just the fourth delivery as last game\u2019s heroVaibhav Suryavanshi, got a reality check in life, getting dismissed for a two-ball duckby Deepak Chahar.Suryavanshi\u2019s early departure had little effect on his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit Trent Boult for two maximums. However, it was the left-arm seamer who had the last laugh by dismantling his stumps on 13 (6).IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesWith both openers back in the pavilion, captain Riyan Parag walked to the crease and played a few shots to keep the required run rate in check. However, there was no stopping Trent Boult (3/28), who further got Nitish Rana holed out to deep square leg as the RR batter couldn\u2019t make the most of his drop catch in the previous over.After Rana\u2019s dismissal, Rajasthan were reduced to 41/3 in four overs, but their worst was yet to come as MI skipper unleashed a hungry Jasprit Bumrah (2/15) on them. The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai\u2019s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.At the other end,Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 ballsas the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn\u2019t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn\u2019t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai\u2019s innings.Meanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the other hand, Rajasthan will look to salvage some pride in their remaining matches as they lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 4 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar. He became the youngest man to secure an IPL contract when he was bought for Rs 1.1 crore by Rajasthan Royals in the mega auction last year when he was still 13.Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his first-class debut for Bihar in January 2024 at just 12 years and 284 days old. In his debut outing, he scored 71 off 42 balls against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, becoming the youngest Indian to hit a List-A fifty. On the international stage, he smashed a 58-ball century against Australia in Chennai, setting the record for the fastest youth Test hundred by an Indian, and played a key role in India\u2019s run to the ACC U19 Asia Cup final with two vital half-centuries.- EndsPublished",

Vaibhav smashed a 35-ball hundred, becoming the youngest player to score a century in Twenty20 cricket on Monday, 28 April. Speaking to the broadcasters during the marquee clash between Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, Gavaskar stressed the need to nurture the teenager carefully.Vaibhav registered the fastest hundred by an Indianin the IPL, striking 11 sixes against a potent Gujarat Titans attack. He batted fearlessly, sending as many as three sixes over 85 metres. The knock left the cricketing world in awe, with many lavishing praise on the young left-hander for his groundbreaking performance.Vaibhav's childhood coach, Manish Ojha, speaking to IndiaToday.in,said he is confident the youngster will make his Twenty20 debutfor India within the next two years, adding further to the growing excitement around the talented opener from Bihar.\"Not at all, not at all. I mean, look \u2014 when he entered the auction, he had already scored a hundred against Australia in a youth Test, and that was against a pretty good attack. For a 13-year-old to score a hundred against an international team, albeit not their top side, still shows the lad had talent. And he has just gone on and on from there,\" Gavaskar told JioStar.\"I think he\u2019s going to develop his game even more. Sitting with Rahul Dravid, he will learn how to temper his innings \u2014 he is only going to get better and better. I do believe that he is someone we shouldn\u2019t praise to the skies.\"And in this case, we just get the feeling, even in his very first game, with the first ball he faced, he hit it for six. Now, that should not become something he feels he must live up to every time. Experienced bowlers will think, \u2018Ah, he wants to hit the first ball for six?\u2019 They will bowl it short, and then he might get out. Then, he could start to worry and overthink things.\"But really, anyone who scores 50 or 60 in a T20 match has done well. To get a hundred at this level is absolutely magnificent, especially against the quality of bowlers he\u2019s facing today \u2014 literally some of the best in the world,\" Gavaskar added.Rajasthan Royals head coach Rahul Dravid also spokeabout how the 14-year-old must be prepared to handle the pressures that come with success at such a tender age.\"You cannot entirely avoid criticism or the media attention around him. I don\u2019t think you can control everything, and I believe you have to accept that. The idea is to help him navigate it and build a strong support system around him. It's part of becoming a cricketer in India \u2014 you have to handle it. We all recognise that he will have some success and some failures,\" Dravid said in the JioStar Press Room.- EndsPublished",

The incident took place in the second over of the innings as Fazalhaq Farooqi trapped him in front of the stumps.The MI opener was given out on the field, and was reluctant to go for DRS. However, he decided to get the decision reviewed by the third umpire at the very last second. Much to his good fortune, the ball pitched outside the leg stump and the decision was overturned. After the decision was overturned, Rohit was seen heaving a sigh of relief as he had a big smile on his face.IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesRohit used his reprieve well as he went on to score his third half-century of the season. He reached the landmark in 31 balls despite a slow start. Rohit's innings came to an end on 53 (36) as he whacked nine fours in his innings. The opening batter tried to hit Riyan Parag down the ground but ended up getting caught at long off by Yashasvi Jaiswal.During his innings, he also completed 6000 runs for the Mumbai Indians. Earlier, Rohit found his form after starting the season on a disappointing note.

Yadav said that he couldn't sleep the night before debuting for MI.\"I barely slept the night before my debut for Mumbai Indians \u2014 went to bed around 4 or 5 in the morning.

It felt really good,\u201d Suryakumar said.\u2018Enjoy the game\u2019After making his IPL debut, Suryakumar had to grind hard in the IPL and domestic cricket before making his international debut in 2021.\"You keep working hard and wait for your chance, but it's natural to wonder \u2014 when will it come? When it finally does, if you put too much pressure on yourself, it doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve learned to just enjoy the game, stay true to myself, and go back to work if things don\u2019t click.

The victory extended their winning streak to six matches as they climbed to the top of the points table.Listen to StoryLive TVShareJasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya (AP Photo)Rishabh BeniwalNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 23:36 ISTIn ShortMumbai Indians scored 217/2 in 20 overs batting firstRajasthan Royals got bundled out for 117 in 16.1 oversMumbai Indians extended their winning streak to seven matchesMumbai Indians (MI) have made a roaring comeback in the Indian Premier League 2025 (IPL 2025) as they extended their winning streak to six matches with a 100-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR). The Hardik Pandya-led side played at its dominating best, crushing Rajasthan on Thursday, May 1, at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, to knock them out of the competition.The victory also helped MI end their 12-year winning drought in Jaipur, with their last victory at the venue coming way back in 2013. A hapless Rajasthan batting line-up could only score 117 in 16.1 overs chasing a massive target of 218, with Jofra Archer top scoring with 30 (27). Following their commanding victory, Mumbai climbed to the top of the points table with seven wins from 11 matches, having 14 points to their name.On the other hand, Rajasthan maintained eighth spot, with three wins from ten matches, having six points. It has been a remarkable comeback for Mumbai, who won just one out of the first five matches.A ruthless bowling displayDefending a massive score, the potent bowling attack of Mumbai was hungry to pounce on Rajasthan. The carnage with the ball began on just the fourth delivery as last game\u2019s heroVaibhav Suryavanshi, got a reality check in life, getting dismissed for a two-ball duckby Deepak Chahar.Suryavanshi\u2019s early departure had little effect on his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit Trent Boult for two maximums. However, it was the left-arm seamer who had the last laugh by dismantling his stumps on 13 (6).IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesWith both openers back in the pavilion, captain Riyan Parag walked to the crease and played a few shots to keep the required run rate in check. However, there was no stopping Trent Boult (3/28), who further got Nitish Rana holed out to deep square leg as the RR batter couldn\u2019t make the most of his drop catch in the previous over.After Rana\u2019s dismissal, Rajasthan were reduced to 41/3 in four overs, but their worst was yet to come as MI skipper unleashed a hungry Jasprit Bumrah (2/15) on them. The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai\u2019s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.At the other end,Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 ballsas the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn\u2019t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn\u2019t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai\u2019s innings.Meanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the other hand, Rajasthan will look to salvage some pride in their remaining matches as they lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 4 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar.

In his debut outing, he scored 71 off 42 balls against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, becoming the youngest Indian to hit a List-A fifty.

Vaibhav smashed a 35-ball hundred, becoming the youngest player to score a century in Twenty20 cricket on Monday, 28 April. Speaking to the broadcasters during the marquee clash between Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, Gavaskar stressed the need to nurture the teenager carefully.Vaibhav registered the fastest hundred by an Indianin the IPL, striking 11 sixes against a potent Gujarat Titans attack. He batted fearlessly, sending as many as three sixes over 85 metres. The knock left the cricketing world in awe, with many lavishing praise on the young left-hander for his groundbreaking performance.Vaibhav's childhood coach, Manish Ojha, speaking to IndiaToday.in,said he is confident the youngster will make his Twenty20 debutfor India within the next two years, adding further to the growing excitement around the talented opener from Bihar.\"Not at all, not at all. I mean, look \u2014 when he entered the auction, he had already scored a hundred against Australia in a youth Test, and that was against a pretty good attack. For a 13-year-old to score a hundred against an international team, albeit not their top side, still shows the lad had talent. And he has just gone on and on from there,\" Gavaskar told JioStar.\"I think he\u2019s going to develop his game even more. Sitting with Rahul Dravid, he will learn how to temper his innings \u2014 he is only going to get better and better. I do believe that he is someone we shouldn\u2019t praise to the skies.\"And in this case, we just get the feeling, even in his very first game, with the first ball he faced, he hit it for six. Now, that should not become something he feels he must live up to every time. Experienced bowlers will think, \u2018Ah, he wants to hit the first ball for six?\u2019 They will bowl it short, and then he might get out. Then, he could start to worry and overthink things.\"But really, anyone who scores 50 or 60 in a T20 match has done well. To get a hundred at this level is absolutely magnificent, especially against the quality of bowlers he\u2019s facing today \u2014 literally some of the best in the world,\" Gavaskar added.Rajasthan Royals head coach Rahul Dravid also spokeabout how the 14-year-old must be prepared to handle the pressures that come with success at such a tender age.\"You cannot entirely avoid criticism or the media attention around him. I don\u2019t think you can control everything, and I believe you have to accept that. The idea is to help him navigate it and build a strong support system around him. It's part of becoming a cricketer in India \u2014 you have to handle it. We all recognise that he will have some success and some failures,\" Dravid said in the JioStar Press Room.- EndsPublished",

The players from India\u2019s Under-19 World Cup-winning squad were put in a draft, and all eight teams had to choose the players one by one.Delhi ended up picking left-arm seamer Pradeep Sangwaninstead of the Under-19 captain Virat Kohli, a move which is seen as the biggest missed opportunity in the history of IPL. Recently, Sehwag explained the reasoning behind the move and revealed that since Delhi was full of several batters, they needed a bowler and hence ended up choosing Pradeep Sangwan.\"I was the captain who didn\u2019t pick Virat Kohli, and chose Pradeep Sangwan. He wasn\u2019t even on the auction table. We already had \u2014 I was there, Gautam Gambhir, Shikhar Dhawan, Dilshan \u2014 we had so many top-order openers. Then there was AB de Villiers too. So we already had a lot of batsmen, but we didn\u2019t have bowlers. Our thinking was, let\u2019s pick a bowler, and a left-arm one to bring some variety. So maybe that was a good choice \u2014 Mahesh and Pradeep Sangwan, these were two young bowlers at the time. In the first three years we played, both of them did well for us,\u201d Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.Sangwan had a quiet season in 2008 as he ended up picking five wickets in the seven innings. However, he made a strong comeback in the next season ashe scalped 15 wickets from 13 innings in Delhi\u2019s run to the semi-final.Sangwan played for three seasons in Delhi and scalped 29 wickets.On the other hand, Virat Kohli went on to become a legend of the game in the following years as he now holds the record for most runs scored in the history of IPL. The star batter remains the only player to play for a single team in IPL history across all seasons and is also the poster boy for the T20 extravaganza.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Gill could not field against Rajasthan Royals in GT's last match after suffering a back spasm on April 28, Monday.Gujarat have done well in the IPL this season and have 12 points from 9 matches. They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.Gujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH.GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game,with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition.

We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match.

The players from India\u2019s Under-19 World Cup-winning squad were put in a draft, and all eight teams had to choose the players one by one.Delhi ended up picking left-arm seamer Pradeep Sangwaninstead of the Under-19 captain Virat Kohli, a move which is seen as the biggest missed opportunity in the history of IPL. Recently, Sehwag explained the reasoning behind the move and revealed that since Delhi was full of several batters, they needed a bowler and hence ended up choosing Pradeep Sangwan.\"I was the captain who didn\u2019t pick Virat Kohli, and chose Pradeep Sangwan. He wasn\u2019t even on the auction table. We already had \u2014 I was there, Gautam Gambhir, Shikhar Dhawan, Dilshan \u2014 we had so many top-order openers. Then there was AB de Villiers too. So we already had a lot of batsmen, but we didn\u2019t have bowlers. Our thinking was, let\u2019s pick a bowler, and a left-arm one to bring some variety. So maybe that was a good choice \u2014 Mahesh and Pradeep Sangwan, these were two young bowlers at the time. In the first three years we played, both of them did well for us,\u201d Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.Sangwan had a quiet season in 2008 as he ended up picking five wickets in the seven innings. However, he made a strong comeback in the next season ashe scalped 15 wickets from 13 innings in Delhi\u2019s run to the semi-final.Sangwan played for three seasons in Delhi and scalped 29 wickets.On the other hand, Virat Kohli went on to become a legend of the game in the following years as he now holds the record for most runs scored in the history of IPL. The star batter remains the only player to play for a single team in IPL history across all seasons and is also the poster boy for the T20 extravaganza.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Gill suffered back spasm during the team's previous match vs Rajasthan Royals.Listen to StoryLive TVShareShubman Gill trains before match vs SRH. (PTI Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 22:30 ISTIn ShortGujarat face Hyderabad in their 10th match of IPL 2025GT have performed strongly this seasonGill suffered a back spasm vs RRGujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill is likely to play against SunRisers Hyderabad despite suffering a back issue in the last game. Gill could not field against Rajasthan Royals in GT's last match after suffering a back spasm on April 28, Monday.Gujarat have done well in the IPL this season and have 12 points from 9 matches. They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.Gujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH.GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game,with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition. Vaibhav scored a 35-ball hundred, the second fastest in IPL history, to hand GT their first defeat in 3 matches.\u201cHis fitness, there was a bit of a back spasm. We\u2019re just trying to be careful with it. He'll be at training today. We'll just see where he's at. We're reasonably confident that he's going to be OK,\u201d said Solanki on the eve of GT\u2019s game against SRH in Ahmedabad.Solanki insisted that Suryavanshi\u2019s bruising 35-ball 100 has not heaped any extra pressure on his side.\u201cFirstly, I don't think the team has been decimated or anything of the sort. We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match. All eyes will be on SRH batters vs Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna \u2014 two pacers who have been on song this season.- EndsPublished",

The incident took place in the second over of the innings as Fazalhaq Farooqi trapped him in front of the stumps.The MI opener was given out on the field, and was reluctant to go for DRS. However, he decided to get the decision reviewed by the third umpire at the very last second. Much to his good fortune, the ball pitched outside the leg stump and the decision was overturned. After the decision was overturned, Rohit was seen heaving a sigh of relief as he had a big smile on his face.IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesRohit used his reprieve well as he went on to score his third half-century of the season. He reached the landmark in 31 balls despite a slow start. Rohit's innings came to an end on 53 (36) as he whacked nine fours in his innings. The opening batter tried to hit Riyan Parag down the ground but ended up getting caught at long off by Yashasvi Jaiswal.During his innings, he also completed 6000 runs for the Mumbai Indians. Earlier, Rohit found his form after starting the season on a disappointing note.

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar.

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar.

If Shadman could score 200, I could hit a 100, or Mushfiqur Rahim scored 150, I would be happier, rather than everyone scoring 40s. Losing a wicket after getting set is not a good sign, as this can't enhance our confidence.

It is played in both singles and doubles format using a paddle and a perforated hollow plastic ball volleyed across a court that is the same size as a doubles' badminton court with a slightly low-placed net.\"This is a defining moment, but we see it as just the beginning. Our focus is firmly on the future, building a pipeline of talent, creating career opportunities, and ensuring every Indian has access to the joy and benefits of pickleball,\" IPA President Suryaveer Singh Bhullar posted on Instagram.AIPA QUESTIONS GOVERNMENT 'S DECISIONThe AIPA issued a statement questioning the ministry's move, claiming it to be the \"pioneering body responsible for introducing and nurturing Pickleball in India since 2007\u201308.\"\"This decision is not only disheartening but raises serious concerns regarding transparency and fairness in sports governance. In the interest of fair play and sportsmanship, we urge the Ministry to reconsider its decision and uphold the values of clean sports,\" AIPA President Arvind Prabhoo stated.The AIPA cited a clause in the 2011 National Sports Code which mandates that for a body to be considered a National Sports Federation, it should have \"actively existed for more than three years on the date of application for recognition.\"The IPA was registered in November last year as per the records of the Registrar of Companies, while the AIPA had completed this formality back in 2008.The AIPA statement alleged that the Ministry's move appears to have been influenced by \"undue lobbying and misleading representations made by the newly formed entity.\"\"The AIPA gave a representation to the Sports Ministry on October 18 last year. But the Ministry has decided to grant recognition to a four-month old company that has no organisational set-up, no district level presence like us,\" AIPA Treasurer Nikhil Mathare told PTI.\"Given the exemptions that have been made for AIPA, we are left with no choice but to take legal recourse. But we will have a conversation with the ministry before we proceed with it,\" he added.Pickleball's global administration has also witnessed a fair number of tug of wars over the years. There are three bodies that claim to be global governing bodies of the sport.The International Pickleball Federation (IPF), the World Pickleball Federation (WPF) and the Global Pickleball Federation (GPF). The IPF came into existence in 2010, followed by the WPF in 2018, while the GPF was founded in 2023 after the USA broke ranks with the IPF- EndsPublished",

On Wednesday, April 30, the Tigers hammered the visitors by an innings and 106 runs at the Bir Sreshtho Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman Stadium in Chattogram.Mehidy Hasan Miraz picked up a five-wicket and also scored 104 as Bangladesh finished the two-match series 1-1. Shadman Islam and Taijul Islam also scored a hundred and took a six-wicket haul respectively. But Shanto said that the home team missed out on a golden chance of winning the series.\"I'm not really happy. If you look at the whole series, we should have played better cricket. We didn't perform well in the first Test. Although we made a comeback, this is a series we should have won,\u201d Shanto told the reporters after the match.Bangladesh lost the opening Test in Sylhet by three wicketsin Sylhet before making a comeback in Chattogram. Shanto said that his team\u2019s batters need to learn how to convert starts into big scores.\"We played poor cricket in the first Test so it was important to bounce back. We won in Pakistan and the West Indies earlier and that means we have that ability. We just need to play according to our potential,\u201d Shanto said.\"As a captain, I don't want this kind of scoreboard. If Shadman could score 200, I could hit a 100, or Mushfiqur Rahim scored 150, I would be happier, rather than everyone scoring 40s. Losing a wicket after getting set is not a good sign, as this can't enhance our confidence. In Sri Lanka, whoever gets set, should score 150-200,\" Shanto added.Shanto had a decent series with the bat in hand after he scored 123 runs from three innings at an average of 41 with a top score of 60.- EndsPublished",

The players from India\u2019s Under-19 World Cup-winning squad were put in a draft, and all eight teams had to choose the players one by one.Delhi ended up picking left-arm seamer Pradeep Sangwaninstead of the Under-19 captain Virat Kohli, a move which is seen as the biggest missed opportunity in the history of IPL. Recently, Sehwag explained the reasoning behind the move and revealed that since Delhi was full of several batters, they needed a bowler and hence ended up choosing Pradeep Sangwan.\"I was the captain who didn\u2019t pick Virat Kohli, and chose Pradeep Sangwan. He wasn\u2019t even on the auction table. We already had \u2014 I was there, Gautam Gambhir, Shikhar Dhawan, Dilshan \u2014 we had so many top-order openers. Then there was AB de Villiers too. So we already had a lot of batsmen, but we didn\u2019t have bowlers. Our thinking was, let\u2019s pick a bowler, and a left-arm one to bring some variety. So maybe that was a good choice \u2014 Mahesh and Pradeep Sangwan, these were two young bowlers at the time. In the first three years we played, both of them did well for us,\u201d Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.Sangwan had a quiet season in 2008 as he ended up picking five wickets in the seven innings. However, he made a strong comeback in the next season ashe scalped 15 wickets from 13 innings in Delhi\u2019s run to the semi-final.Sangwan played for three seasons in Delhi and scalped 29 wickets.On the other hand, Virat Kohli went on to become a legend of the game in the following years as he now holds the record for most runs scored in the history of IPL. The star batter remains the only player to play for a single team in IPL history across all seasons and is also the poster boy for the T20 extravaganza.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.Gujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH.GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game,with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition.

We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match.

The players from India\u2019s Under-19 World Cup-winning squad were put in a draft, and all eight teams had to choose the players one by one.Delhi ended up picking left-arm seamer Pradeep Sangwaninstead of the Under-19 captain Virat Kohli, a move which is seen as the biggest missed opportunity in the history of IPL. Recently, Sehwag explained the reasoning behind the move and revealed that since Delhi was full of several batters, they needed a bowler and hence ended up choosing Pradeep Sangwan.\"I was the captain who didn\u2019t pick Virat Kohli, and chose Pradeep Sangwan. He wasn\u2019t even on the auction table. We already had \u2014 I was there, Gautam Gambhir, Shikhar Dhawan, Dilshan \u2014 we had so many top-order openers. Then there was AB de Villiers too. So we already had a lot of batsmen, but we didn\u2019t have bowlers. Our thinking was, let\u2019s pick a bowler, and a left-arm one to bring some variety. So maybe that was a good choice \u2014 Mahesh and Pradeep Sangwan, these were two young bowlers at the time. In the first three years we played, both of them did well for us,\u201d Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.Sangwan had a quiet season in 2008 as he ended up picking five wickets in the seven innings. However, he made a strong comeback in the next season ashe scalped 15 wickets from 13 innings in Delhi\u2019s run to the semi-final.Sangwan played for three seasons in Delhi and scalped 29 wickets.On the other hand, Virat Kohli went on to become a legend of the game in the following years as he now holds the record for most runs scored in the history of IPL. The star batter remains the only player to play for a single team in IPL history across all seasons and is also the poster boy for the T20 extravaganza.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

The victory extended their winning streak to six matches as they climbed to the top of the points table.Listen to StoryLive TVShareJasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya (AP Photo)Rishabh BeniwalNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 23:36 ISTIn ShortMumbai Indians scored 217/2 in 20 overs batting firstRajasthan Royals got bundled out for 117 in 16.1 oversMumbai Indians extended their winning streak to seven matchesMumbai Indians (MI) have made a roaring comeback in the Indian Premier League 2025 (IPL 2025) as they extended their winning streak to six matches with a 100-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR). The Hardik Pandya-led side played at its dominating best, crushing Rajasthan on Thursday, May 1, at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, to knock them out of the competition.The victory also helped MI end their 12-year winning drought in Jaipur, with their last victory at the venue coming way back in 2013. A hapless Rajasthan batting line-up could only score 117 in 16.1 overs chasing a massive target of 218, with Jofra Archer top scoring with 30 (27). Following their commanding victory, Mumbai climbed to the top of the points table with seven wins from 11 matches, having 14 points to their name.On the other hand, Rajasthan maintained eighth spot, with three wins from ten matches, having six points. It has been a remarkable comeback for Mumbai, who won just one out of the first five matches.A ruthless bowling displayDefending a massive score, the potent bowling attack of Mumbai was hungry to pounce on Rajasthan. The carnage with the ball began on just the fourth delivery as last game\u2019s heroVaibhav Suryavanshi, got a reality check in life, getting dismissed for a two-ball duckby Deepak Chahar.Suryavanshi\u2019s early departure had little effect on his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit Trent Boult for two maximums. However, it was the left-arm seamer who had the last laugh by dismantling his stumps on 13 (6).IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesWith both openers back in the pavilion, captain Riyan Parag walked to the crease and played a few shots to keep the required run rate in check. However, there was no stopping Trent Boult (3/28), who further got Nitish Rana holed out to deep square leg as the RR batter couldn\u2019t make the most of his drop catch in the previous over.After Rana\u2019s dismissal, Rajasthan were reduced to 41/3 in four overs, but their worst was yet to come as MI skipper unleashed a hungry Jasprit Bumrah (2/15) on them. The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai\u2019s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.At the other end,Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 ballsas the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn\u2019t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn\u2019t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai\u2019s innings.Meanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.

The players from India\u2019s Under-19 World Cup-winning squad were put in a draft, and all eight teams had to choose the players one by one.Delhi ended up picking left-arm seamer Pradeep Sangwaninstead of the Under-19 captain Virat Kohli, a move which is seen as the biggest missed opportunity in the history of IPL. Recently, Sehwag explained the reasoning behind the move and revealed that since Delhi was full of several batters, they needed a bowler and hence ended up choosing Pradeep Sangwan.\"I was the captain who didn\u2019t pick Virat Kohli, and chose Pradeep Sangwan. He wasn\u2019t even on the auction table. We already had \u2014 I was there, Gautam Gambhir, Shikhar Dhawan, Dilshan \u2014 we had so many top-order openers. Then there was AB de Villiers too. So we already had a lot of batsmen, but we didn\u2019t have bowlers. Our thinking was, let\u2019s pick a bowler, and a left-arm one to bring some variety. So maybe that was a good choice \u2014 Mahesh and Pradeep Sangwan, these were two young bowlers at the time. In the first three years we played, both of them did well for us,\u201d Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.Sangwan had a quiet season in 2008 as he ended up picking five wickets in the seven innings. However, he made a strong comeback in the next season ashe scalped 15 wickets from 13 innings in Delhi\u2019s run to the semi-final.Sangwan played for three seasons in Delhi and scalped 29 wickets.On the other hand, Virat Kohli went on to become a legend of the game in the following years as he now holds the record for most runs scored in the history of IPL. The star batter remains the only player to play for a single team in IPL history across all seasons and is also the poster boy for the T20 extravaganza.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar.

Gill could not field against Rajasthan Royals in GT's last match after suffering a back spasm on April 28, Monday.Gujarat have done well in the IPL this season and have 12 points from 9 matches. They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.Gujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH.GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game,with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition. Vaibhav scored a 35-ball hundred, the second fastest in IPL history, to hand GT their first defeat in 3 matches.\u201cHis fitness, there was a bit of a back spasm. We\u2019re just trying to be careful with it. He'll be at training today. We'll just see where he's at. We're reasonably confident that he's going to be OK,\u201d said Solanki on the eve of GT\u2019s game against SRH in Ahmedabad.Solanki insisted that Suryavanshi\u2019s bruising 35-ball 100 has not heaped any extra pressure on his side.\u201cFirstly, I don't think the team has been decimated or anything of the sort. We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match.

It is played in both singles and doubles format using a paddle and a perforated hollow plastic ball volleyed across a court that is the same size as a doubles' badminton court with a slightly low-placed net.\"This is a defining moment, but we see it as just the beginning. Our focus is firmly on the future, building a pipeline of talent, creating career opportunities, and ensuring every Indian has access to the joy and benefits of pickleball,\" IPA President Suryaveer Singh Bhullar posted on Instagram.AIPA QUESTIONS GOVERNMENT 'S DECISIONThe AIPA issued a statement questioning the ministry's move, claiming it to be the \"pioneering body responsible for introducing and nurturing Pickleball in India since 2007\u201308.\"\"This decision is not only disheartening but raises serious concerns regarding transparency and fairness in sports governance. In the interest of fair play and sportsmanship, we urge the Ministry to reconsider its decision and uphold the values of clean sports,\" AIPA President Arvind Prabhoo stated.The AIPA cited a clause in the 2011 National Sports Code which mandates that for a body to be considered a National Sports Federation, it should have \"actively existed for more than three years on the date of application for recognition.\"The IPA was registered in November last year as per the records of the Registrar of Companies, while the AIPA had completed this formality back in 2008.The AIPA statement alleged that the Ministry's move appears to have been influenced by \"undue lobbying and misleading representations made by the newly formed entity.\"\"The AIPA gave a representation to the Sports Ministry on October 18 last year. But the Ministry has decided to grant recognition to a four-month old company that has no organisational set-up, no district level presence like us,\" AIPA Treasurer Nikhil Mathare told PTI.\"Given the exemptions that have been made for AIPA, we are left with no choice but to take legal recourse. But we will have a conversation with the ministry before we proceed with it,\" he added.Pickleball's global administration has also witnessed a fair number of tug of wars over the years. There are three bodies that claim to be global governing bodies of the sport.The International Pickleball Federation (IPF), the World Pickleball Federation (WPF) and the Global Pickleball Federation (GPF). The IPF came into existence in 2010, followed by the WPF in 2018, while the GPF was founded in 2023 after the USA broke ranks with the IPF- EndsPublished",

The Hardik Pandya-led side played at its dominating best, crushing Rajasthan on Thursday, May 1, at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, to knock them out of the competition.The victory also helped MI end their 12-year winning drought in Jaipur, with their last victory at the venue coming way back in 2013. A hapless Rajasthan batting line-up could only score 117 in 16.1 overs chasing a massive target of 218, with Jofra Archer top scoring with 30 (27). Following their commanding victory, Mumbai climbed to the top of the points table with seven wins from 11 matches, having 14 points to their name.On the other hand, Rajasthan maintained eighth spot, with three wins from ten matches, having six points. It has been a remarkable comeback for Mumbai, who won just one out of the first five matches.A ruthless bowling displayDefending a massive score, the potent bowling attack of Mumbai was hungry to pounce on Rajasthan. The carnage with the ball began on just the fourth delivery as last game\u2019s heroVaibhav Suryavanshi, got a reality check in life, getting dismissed for a two-ball duckby Deepak Chahar.Suryavanshi\u2019s early departure had little effect on his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit Trent Boult for two maximums. However, it was the left-arm seamer who had the last laugh by dismantling his stumps on 13 (6).IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesWith both openers back in the pavilion, captain Riyan Parag walked to the crease and played a few shots to keep the required run rate in check. However, there was no stopping Trent Boult (3/28), who further got Nitish Rana holed out to deep square leg as the RR batter couldn\u2019t make the most of his drop catch in the previous over.After Rana\u2019s dismissal, Rajasthan were reduced to 41/3 in four overs, but their worst was yet to come as MI skipper unleashed a hungry Jasprit Bumrah (2/15) on them. The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai\u2019s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.At the other end,Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 ballsas the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn\u2019t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn\u2019t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai\u2019s innings.Meanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the other hand, Rajasthan will look to salvage some pride in their remaining matches as they lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 4 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar. He became the youngest man to secure an IPL contract when he was bought for Rs 1.1 crore by Rajasthan Royals in the mega auction last year when he was still 13.Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his first-class debut for Bihar in January 2024 at just 12 years and 284 days old. In his debut outing, he scored 71 off 42 balls against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, becoming the youngest Indian to hit a List-A fifty. On the international stage, he smashed a 58-ball century against Australia in Chennai, setting the record for the fastest youth Test hundred by an Indian, and played a key role in India\u2019s run to the ACC U19 Asia Cup final with two vital half-centuries.- EndsPublished",

Gill could not field against Rajasthan Royals in GT's last match after suffering a back spasm on April 28, Monday.Gujarat have done well in the IPL this season and have 12 points from 9 matches. They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.Gujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH.GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game,with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition. Vaibhav scored a 35-ball hundred, the second fastest in IPL history, to hand GT their first defeat in 3 matches.\u201cHis fitness, there was a bit of a back spasm. We\u2019re just trying to be careful with it. He'll be at training today. We'll just see where he's at. We're reasonably confident that he's going to be OK,\u201d said Solanki on the eve of GT\u2019s game against SRH in Ahmedabad.Solanki insisted that Suryavanshi\u2019s bruising 35-ball 100 has not heaped any extra pressure on his side.\u201cFirstly, I don't think the team has been decimated or anything of the sort. We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match.

Vaibhav smashed a 35-ball hundred, becoming the youngest player to score a century in Twenty20 cricket on Monday, 28 April. Speaking to the broadcasters during the marquee clash between Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, Gavaskar stressed the need to nurture the teenager carefully.Vaibhav registered the fastest hundred by an Indianin the IPL, striking 11 sixes against a potent Gujarat Titans attack. He batted fearlessly, sending as many as three sixes over 85 metres. The knock left the cricketing world in awe, with many lavishing praise on the young left-hander for his groundbreaking performance.Vaibhav's childhood coach, Manish Ojha, speaking to IndiaToday.in,said he is confident the youngster will make his Twenty20 debutfor India within the next two years, adding further to the growing excitement around the talented opener from Bihar.\"Not at all, not at all. I mean, look \u2014 when he entered the auction, he had already scored a hundred against Australia in a youth Test, and that was against a pretty good attack. For a 13-year-old to score a hundred against an international team, albeit not their top side, still shows the lad had talent. And he has just gone on and on from there,\" Gavaskar told JioStar.\"I think he\u2019s going to develop his game even more. Sitting with Rahul Dravid, he will learn how to temper his innings \u2014 he is only going to get better and better. I do believe that he is someone we shouldn\u2019t praise to the skies.\"And in this case, we just get the feeling, even in his very first game, with the first ball he faced, he hit it for six. Now, that should not become something he feels he must live up to every time. Experienced bowlers will think, \u2018Ah, he wants to hit the first ball for six?\u2019 They will bowl it short, and then he might get out. Then, he could start to worry and overthink things.\"But really, anyone who scores 50 or 60 in a T20 match has done well. To get a hundred at this level is absolutely magnificent, especially against the quality of bowlers he\u2019s facing today \u2014 literally some of the best in the world,\" Gavaskar added.Rajasthan Royals head coach Rahul Dravid also spokeabout how the 14-year-old must be prepared to handle the pressures that come with success at such a tender age.\"You cannot entirely avoid criticism or the media attention around him. I don\u2019t think you can control everything, and I believe you have to accept that. The idea is to help him navigate it and build a strong support system around him. It's part of becoming a cricketer in India \u2014 you have to handle it. We all recognise that he will have some success and some failures,\" Dravid said in the JioStar Press Room.- EndsPublished",

The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai\u2019s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.At the other end,Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 ballsas the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn\u2019t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn\u2019t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai\u2019s innings.Meanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the other hand, Rajasthan will look to salvage some pride in their remaining matches as they lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 4 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Back in 2012, Suryakumar stepped out for Mumbai Indians (MI) against the now-defunct Pune Warriors at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.Suryakumar didn\u2019t have a memorable outing after Marlon Samuels dismissed him for a four-ball duck. MI lost the match by 28 runs after struggling to 101 for nine while chasing 130. Yadav said that he couldn't sleep the night before debuting for MI.\"I barely slept the night before my debut for Mumbai Indians \u2014 went to bed around 4 or 5 in the morning. There was so much excitement. Playing for a franchise brings a different kind of buzz.

It felt really good,\u201d Suryakumar said.\u2018Enjoy the game\u2019After making his IPL debut, Suryakumar had to grind hard in the IPL and domestic cricket before making his international debut in 2021.\"You keep working hard and wait for your chance, but it's natural to wonder \u2014 when will it come? When it finally does, if you put too much pressure on yourself, it doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve learned to just enjoy the game, stay true to myself, and go back to work if things don\u2019t click. That mindset came from years of playing domestic cricket,\u201d Suryakumar added.Suryakumar also became the World No.1 in T20Is, showing his effectiveness in the 20-over format of the game.

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar. He became the youngest man to secure an IPL contract when he was bought for Rs 1.1 crore by Rajasthan Royals in the mega auction last year when he was still 13.Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his first-class debut for Bihar in January 2024 at just 12 years and 284 days old. In his debut outing, he scored 71 off 42 balls against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, becoming the youngest Indian to hit a List-A fifty. On the international stage, he smashed a 58-ball century against Australia in Chennai, setting the record for the fastest youth Test hundred by an Indian, and played a key role in India\u2019s run to the ACC U19 Asia Cup final with two vital half-centuries.- EndsPublished",

Vaibhav smashed a 35-ball hundred, becoming the youngest player to score a century in Twenty20 cricket on Monday, 28 April. Speaking to the broadcasters during the marquee clash between Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, Gavaskar stressed the need to nurture the teenager carefully.Vaibhav registered the fastest hundred by an Indianin the IPL, striking 11 sixes against a potent Gujarat Titans attack. He batted fearlessly, sending as many as three sixes over 85 metres. The knock left the cricketing world in awe, with many lavishing praise on the young left-hander for his groundbreaking performance.Vaibhav's childhood coach, Manish Ojha, speaking to IndiaToday.in,said he is confident the youngster will make his Twenty20 debutfor India within the next two years, adding further to the growing excitement around the talented opener from Bihar.\"Not at all, not at all. I mean, look \u2014 when he entered the auction, he had already scored a hundred against Australia in a youth Test, and that was against a pretty good attack. For a 13-year-old to score a hundred against an international team, albeit not their top side, still shows the lad had talent. And he has just gone on and on from there,\" Gavaskar told JioStar.\"I think he\u2019s going to develop his game even more. Sitting with Rahul Dravid, he will learn how to temper his innings \u2014 he is only going to get better and better. I do believe that he is someone we shouldn\u2019t praise to the skies.\"And in this case, we just get the feeling, even in his very first game, with the first ball he faced, he hit it for six. Now, that should not become something he feels he must live up to every time. Experienced bowlers will think, \u2018Ah, he wants to hit the first ball for six?\u2019 They will bowl it short, and then he might get out. Then, he could start to worry and overthink things.\"But really, anyone who scores 50 or 60 in a T20 match has done well. To get a hundred at this level is absolutely magnificent, especially against the quality of bowlers he\u2019s facing today \u2014 literally some of the best in the world,\" Gavaskar added.Rajasthan Royals head coach Rahul Dravid also spokeabout how the 14-year-old must be prepared to handle the pressures that come with success at such a tender age.\"You cannot entirely avoid criticism or the media attention around him. I don\u2019t think you can control everything, and I believe you have to accept that. The idea is to help him navigate it and build a strong support system around him. It's part of becoming a cricketer in India \u2014 you have to handle it. We all recognise that he will have some success and some failures,\" Dravid said in the JioStar Press Room.- EndsPublished",

The incident took place in the second over of the innings as Fazalhaq Farooqi trapped him in front of the stumps.The MI opener was given out on the field, and was reluctant to go for DRS. However, he decided to get the decision reviewed by the third umpire at the very last second. Much to his good fortune, the ball pitched outside the leg stump and the decision was overturned. After the decision was overturned, Rohit was seen heaving a sigh of relief as he had a big smile on his face.IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesRohit used his reprieve well as he went on to score his third half-century of the season. He reached the landmark in 31 balls despite a slow start. Rohit's innings came to an end on 53 (36) as he whacked nine fours in his innings. The opening batter tried to hit Riyan Parag down the ground but ended up getting caught at long off by Yashasvi Jaiswal.During his innings, he also completed 6000 runs for the Mumbai Indians. Earlier, Rohit found his form after starting the season on a disappointing note. He scored back-to-back match-winning knocks against Chennai Super Kings 76* (45) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) 70 (46), helping Mumbai extend their winning streak to five matches.- EndsPublished",

Back in 2012, Suryakumar stepped out for Mumbai Indians (MI) against the now-defunct Pune Warriors at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.Suryakumar didn\u2019t have a memorable outing after Marlon Samuels dismissed him for a four-ball duck. MI lost the match by 28 runs after struggling to 101 for nine while chasing 130. Yadav said that he couldn't sleep the night before debuting for MI.\"I barely slept the night before my debut for Mumbai Indians \u2014 went to bed around 4 or 5 in the morning. There was so much excitement. Playing for a franchise brings a different kind of buzz. I was just enjoying the moment, thinking about stepping onto the field for warm-up and as soon as I did, I was already sweating. It felt really good,\u201d Suryakumar said.\u2018Enjoy the game\u2019After making his IPL debut, Suryakumar had to grind hard in the IPL and domestic cricket before making his international debut in 2021.\"You keep working hard and wait for your chance, but it's natural to wonder \u2014 when will it come? When it finally does, if you put too much pressure on yourself, it doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve learned to just enjoy the game, stay true to myself, and go back to work if things don\u2019t click. That mindset came from years of playing domestic cricket,\u201d Suryakumar added.Suryakumar also became the World No.1 in T20Is, showing his effectiveness in the 20-over format of the game. In 83 T20Is thus far, Suryakumar has scored 2598 runs at an average of 38.20 with four centuries and 21 half-centuries.Recently,Suryakumar also completed 4000 runs in the IPL.

The victory extended their winning streak to six matches as they climbed to the top of the points table.Listen to StoryLive TVShareJasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya (AP Photo)Rishabh BeniwalNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 23:36 ISTIn ShortMumbai Indians scored 217/2 in 20 overs batting firstRajasthan Royals got bundled out for 117 in 16.1 oversMumbai Indians extended their winning streak to seven matchesMumbai Indians (MI) have made a roaring comeback in the Indian Premier League 2025 (IPL 2025) as they extended their winning streak to six matches with a 100-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR). The Hardik Pandya-led side played at its dominating best, crushing Rajasthan on Thursday, May 1, at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, to knock them out of the competition.The victory also helped MI end their 12-year winning drought in Jaipur, with their last victory at the venue coming way back in 2013. A hapless Rajasthan batting line-up could only score 117 in 16.1 overs chasing a massive target of 218, with Jofra Archer top scoring with 30 (27). Following their commanding victory, Mumbai climbed to the top of the points table with seven wins from 11 matches, having 14 points to their name.On the other hand, Rajasthan maintained eighth spot, with three wins from ten matches, having six points. It has been a remarkable comeback for Mumbai, who won just one out of the first five matches.A ruthless bowling displayDefending a massive score, the potent bowling attack of Mumbai was hungry to pounce on Rajasthan. The carnage with the ball began on just the fourth delivery as last game\u2019s heroVaibhav Suryavanshi, got a reality check in life, getting dismissed for a two-ball duckby Deepak Chahar.Suryavanshi\u2019s early departure had little effect on his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit Trent Boult for two maximums. However, it was the left-arm seamer who had the last laugh by dismantling his stumps on 13 (6).IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesWith both openers back in the pavilion, captain Riyan Parag walked to the crease and played a few shots to keep the required run rate in check. However, there was no stopping Trent Boult (3/28), who further got Nitish Rana holed out to deep square leg as the RR batter couldn\u2019t make the most of his drop catch in the previous over.After Rana\u2019s dismissal, Rajasthan were reduced to 41/3 in four overs, but their worst was yet to come as MI skipper unleashed a hungry Jasprit Bumrah (2/15) on them. The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai\u2019s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.At the other end,Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 ballsas the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn\u2019t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn\u2019t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai\u2019s innings.Meanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the other hand, Rajasthan will look to salvage some pride in their remaining matches as they lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 4 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar. He became the youngest man to secure an IPL contract when he was bought for Rs 1.1 crore by Rajasthan Royals in the mega auction last year when he was still 13.Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his first-class debut for Bihar in January 2024 at just 12 years and 284 days old. In his debut outing, he scored 71 off 42 balls against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, becoming the youngest Indian to hit a List-A fifty. On the international stage, he smashed a 58-ball century against Australia in Chennai, setting the record for the fastest youth Test hundred by an Indian, and played a key role in India\u2019s run to the ACC U19 Asia Cup final with two vital half-centuries.- EndsPublished",

Vaibhav smashed a 35-ball hundred, becoming the youngest player to score a century in Twenty20 cricket on Monday, 28 April. Speaking to the broadcasters during the marquee clash between Rajasthan Royals and Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, Gavaskar stressed the need to nurture the teenager carefully.Vaibhav registered the fastest hundred by an Indianin the IPL, striking 11 sixes against a potent Gujarat Titans attack. He batted fearlessly, sending as many as three sixes over 85 metres. The knock left the cricketing world in awe, with many lavishing praise on the young left-hander for his groundbreaking performance.Vaibhav's childhood coach, Manish Ojha, speaking to IndiaToday.in,said he is confident the youngster will make his Twenty20 debutfor India within the next two years, adding further to the growing excitement around the talented opener from Bihar.\"Not at all, not at all. I mean, look \u2014 when he entered the auction, he had already scored a hundred against Australia in a youth Test, and that was against a pretty good attack. For a 13-year-old to score a hundred against an international team, albeit not their top side, still shows the lad had talent. And he has just gone on and on from there,\" Gavaskar told JioStar.\"I think he\u2019s going to develop his game even more. Sitting with Rahul Dravid, he will learn how to temper his innings \u2014 he is only going to get better and better. I do believe that he is someone we shouldn\u2019t praise to the skies.\"And in this case, we just get the feeling, even in his very first game, with the first ball he faced, he hit it for six. Now, that should not become something he feels he must live up to every time. Experienced bowlers will think, \u2018Ah, he wants to hit the first ball for six?\u2019 They will bowl it short, and then he might get out. Then, he could start to worry and overthink things.\"But really, anyone who scores 50 or 60 in a T20 match has done well. To get a hundred at this level is absolutely magnificent, especially against the quality of bowlers he\u2019s facing today \u2014 literally some of the best in the world,\" Gavaskar added.Rajasthan Royals head coach Rahul Dravid also spokeabout how the 14-year-old must be prepared to handle the pressures that come with success at such a tender age.\"You cannot entirely avoid criticism or the media attention around him. I don\u2019t think you can control everything, and I believe you have to accept that. The idea is to help him navigate it and build a strong support system around him. It's part of becoming a cricketer in India \u2014 you have to handle it. We all recognise that he will have some success and some failures,\" Dravid said in the JioStar Press Room.- EndsPublished",

Gill could not field against Rajasthan Royals in GT's last match after suffering a back spasm on April 28, Monday.Gujarat have done well in the IPL this season and have 12 points from 9 matches. They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.Gujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH.GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game,with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition. Vaibhav scored a 35-ball hundred, the second fastest in IPL history, to hand GT their first defeat in 3 matches.\u201cHis fitness, there was a bit of a back spasm. We\u2019re just trying to be careful with it. He'll be at training today. We'll just see where he's at. We're reasonably confident that he's going to be OK,\u201d said Solanki on the eve of GT\u2019s game against SRH in Ahmedabad.Solanki insisted that Suryavanshi\u2019s bruising 35-ball 100 has not heaped any extra pressure on his side.\u201cFirstly, I don't think the team has been decimated or anything of the sort. We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match. All eyes will be on SRH batters vs Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna \u2014 two pacers who have been on song this season.- EndsPublished",

I knew that with RCB, I had a good chance. I had been practicing \u2014 this had been going on for two years. Until two years ago, I used to play by taking injections.

I was told that I should play after three or four matches because my surgery was quite major.\u201cBut James took such good care of me, better than anyone else could. I\u2019m really thankful that I came to this franchise \u2014 I became completely fit. Otherwise, I have been dealing with this issue for the past two years.

The cricketer married Aesha, who has two daughters from a previous marriage, in 2011, but their relationship ended after several difficult years.A Delhi court that granted Dhawan's divorce noted that he had endured mental distress due to his ex-wife, who had kept him separated from his only son for years.

The court granted him visitation rights and permitted video calls for a 'reasonable period' in both India and Australia, where his estranged wife resides.

The players from India\u2019s Under-19 World Cup-winning squad were put in a draft, and all eight teams had to choose the players one by one.Delhi ended up picking left-arm seamer Pradeep Sangwaninstead of the Under-19 captain Virat Kohli, a move which is seen as the biggest missed opportunity in the history of IPL. Recently, Sehwag explained the reasoning behind the move and revealed that since Delhi was full of several batters, they needed a bowler and hence ended up choosing Pradeep Sangwan.\"I was the captain who didn\u2019t pick Virat Kohli, and chose Pradeep Sangwan. He wasn\u2019t even on the auction table. We already had \u2014 I was there, Gautam Gambhir, Shikhar Dhawan, Dilshan \u2014 we had so many top-order openers. Then there was AB de Villiers too. So we already had a lot of batsmen, but we didn\u2019t have bowlers. Our thinking was, let\u2019s pick a bowler, and a left-arm one to bring some variety. So maybe that was a good choice \u2014 Mahesh and Pradeep Sangwan, these were two young bowlers at the time. In the first three years we played, both of them did well for us,\u201d Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.Sangwan had a quiet season in 2008 as he ended up picking five wickets in the seven innings. However, he made a strong comeback in the next season ashe scalped 15 wickets from 13 innings in Delhi\u2019s run to the semi-final.Sangwan played for three seasons in Delhi and scalped 29 wickets.On the other hand, Virat Kohli went on to become a legend of the game in the following years as he now holds the record for most runs scored in the history of IPL. The star batter remains the only player to play for a single team in IPL history across all seasons and is also the poster boy for the T20 extravaganza.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Gill suffered back spasm during the team's previous match vs Rajasthan Royals.Listen to StoryLive TVShareShubman Gill trains before match vs SRH. (PTI Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 22:30 ISTIn ShortGujarat face Hyderabad in their 10th match of IPL 2025GT have performed strongly this seasonGill suffered a back spasm vs RRGujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill is likely to play against SunRisers Hyderabad despite suffering a back issue in the last game. Gill could not field against Rajasthan Royals in GT's last match after suffering a back spasm on April 28, Monday.Gujarat have done well in the IPL this season and have 12 points from 9 matches. They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.Gujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH.GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game,with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition. Vaibhav scored a 35-ball hundred, the second fastest in IPL history, to hand GT their first defeat in 3 matches.\u201cHis fitness, there was a bit of a back spasm. We\u2019re just trying to be careful with it. He'll be at training today. We'll just see where he's at. We're reasonably confident that he's going to be OK,\u201d said Solanki on the eve of GT\u2019s game against SRH in Ahmedabad.Solanki insisted that Suryavanshi\u2019s bruising 35-ball 100 has not heaped any extra pressure on his side.\u201cFirstly, I don't think the team has been decimated or anything of the sort. We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match. All eyes will be on SRH batters vs Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna \u2014 two pacers who have been on song this season.- EndsPublished",

Gill suffered back spasm during the team's previous match vs Rajasthan Royals.Listen to StoryLive TVShareShubman Gill trains before match vs SRH. (PTI Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 22:30 ISTIn ShortGujarat face Hyderabad in their 10th match of IPL 2025GT have performed strongly this seasonGill suffered a back spasm vs RRGujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill is likely to play against SunRisers Hyderabad despite suffering a back issue in the last game. Gill could not field against Rajasthan Royals in GT's last match after suffering a back spasm on April 28, Monday.Gujarat have done well in the IPL this season and have 12 points from 9 matches. They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.Gujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH.GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game,with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition. Vaibhav scored a 35-ball hundred, the second fastest in IPL history, to hand GT their first defeat in 3 matches.\u201cHis fitness, there was a bit of a back spasm. We\u2019re just trying to be careful with it. He'll be at training today. We'll just see where he's at. We're reasonably confident that he's going to be OK,\u201d said Solanki on the eve of GT\u2019s game against SRH in Ahmedabad.Solanki insisted that Suryavanshi\u2019s bruising 35-ball 100 has not heaped any extra pressure on his side.\u201cFirstly, I don't think the team has been decimated or anything of the sort. We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match. All eyes will be on SRH batters vs Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna \u2014 two pacers who have been on song this season.- EndsPublished",

The incident took place in the second over of the innings as Fazalhaq Farooqi trapped him in front of the stumps.The MI opener was given out on the field, and was reluctant to go for DRS.

When it finally does, if you put too much pressure on yourself, it doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve learned to just enjoy the game, stay true to myself, and go back to work if things don\u2019t click.

It is played in both singles and doubles format using a paddle and a perforated hollow plastic ball volleyed across a court that is the same size as a doubles' badminton court with a slightly low-placed net.\"This is a defining moment, but we see it as just the beginning. Our focus is firmly on the future, building a pipeline of talent, creating career opportunities, and ensuring every Indian has access to the joy and benefits of pickleball,\" IPA President Suryaveer Singh Bhullar posted on Instagram.AIPA QUESTIONS GOVERNMENT 'S DECISIONThe AIPA issued a statement questioning the ministry's move, claiming it to be the \"pioneering body responsible for introducing and nurturing Pickleball in India since 2007\u201308.\"\"This decision is not only disheartening but raises serious concerns regarding transparency and fairness in sports governance. In the interest of fair play and sportsmanship, we urge the Ministry to reconsider its decision and uphold the values of clean sports,\" AIPA President Arvind Prabhoo stated.The AIPA cited a clause in the 2011 National Sports Code which mandates that for a body to be considered a National Sports Federation, it should have \"actively existed for more than three years on the date of application for recognition.\"The IPA was registered in November last year as per the records of the Registrar of Companies, while the AIPA had completed this formality back in 2008.The AIPA statement alleged that the Ministry's move appears to have been influenced by \"undue lobbying and misleading representations made by the newly formed entity.\"\"The AIPA gave a representation to the Sports Ministry on October 18 last year. But the Ministry has decided to grant recognition to a four-month old company that has no organisational set-up, no district level presence like us,\" AIPA Treasurer Nikhil Mathare told PTI.\"Given the exemptions that have been made for AIPA, we are left with no choice but to take legal recourse. But we will have a conversation with the ministry before we proceed with it,\" he added.Pickleball's global administration has also witnessed a fair number of tug of wars over the years. There are three bodies that claim to be global governing bodies of the sport.The International Pickleball Federation (IPF), the World Pickleball Federation (WPF) and the Global Pickleball Federation (GPF). The IPF came into existence in 2010, followed by the WPF in 2018, while the GPF was founded in 2023 after the USA broke ranks with the IPF- EndsPublished",

On Wednesday, April 30, the Tigers hammered the visitors by an innings and 106 runs at the Bir Sreshtho Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman Stadium in Chattogram.Mehidy Hasan Miraz picked up a five-wicket and also scored 104 as Bangladesh finished the two-match series 1-1. Shadman Islam and Taijul Islam also scored a hundred and took a six-wicket haul respectively. But Shanto said that the home team missed out on a golden chance of winning the series.\"I'm not really happy. If you look at the whole series, we should have played better cricket. We didn't perform well in the first Test. Although we made a comeback, this is a series we should have won,\u201d Shanto told the reporters after the match.Bangladesh lost the opening Test in Sylhet by three wicketsin Sylhet before making a comeback in Chattogram. Shanto said that his team\u2019s batters need to learn how to convert starts into big scores.\"We played poor cricket in the first Test so it was important to bounce back. We won in Pakistan and the West Indies earlier and that means we have that ability. We just need to play according to our potential,\u201d Shanto said.\"As a captain, I don't want this kind of scoreboard. If Shadman could score 200, I could hit a 100, or Mushfiqur Rahim scored 150, I would be happier, rather than everyone scoring 40s. Losing a wicket after getting set is not a good sign, as this can't enhance our confidence. In Sri Lanka, whoever gets set, should score 150-200,\" Shanto added.Shanto had a decent series with the bat in hand after he scored 123 runs from three innings at an average of 41 with a top score of 60.- EndsPublished",

The cricketer married Aesha, who has two daughters from a previous marriage, in 2011, but their relationship ended after several difficult years.A Delhi court that granted Dhawan's divorce noted that he had endured mental distress due to his ex-wife, who had kept him separated from his only son for years.

The court granted him visitation rights and permitted video calls for a 'reasonable period' in both India and Australia, where his estranged wife resides.

Yamal's performance was impressive, as he not only scored a goal, but was influential in the build-up to the second one as well.Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand reacted to the player's brilliance and said that the 17-year-old should win the Ballon d'Or if he inspires FC Barcelona to a Champions League victory.\"Ballon d'Or, Ballon d'Or, Ballon d'Or. Lamine Yamal. I don\u2019t think there is anyone more exciting to watch in a stadium now. If he is decisive in Milan and the final, I think he deserves it,\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel after the match.The match against Inter Milan was Yamal's 100th at just 17 years and 291 days. On Wednesday, Yamal became the youngest player to score in a Champions League semi-final, eclipsing the record set by Kylian Mbapp, who was 18 when he achieved the feat in 2017.Lamine Yamal. (Courtesy: Reuters)\"Lamine (Yamal) showed us the way with that incredible goal because it was crucial to score that goal after we were losing by two goals. He played really well,\" Barcelona manager Hansi Flick told Movistar Plus.\"We played with style and we tried to win. Lamine was a very important player for us... In the big games, as he has already shown, he always turns up.\"Inter Milan manager Simone Inzaghi was also full of praise for Yamal, revealing he had to make several adjustments at halftime to try and contain the talented teenager.\"We had to be better on Lamine Yamal, but it's much easier to say that from outside. He is a player who impressed me and he created a lot of problems for us, mainly in the last 30 minutes of the first half,\" Inzaghi said.\"Barca are a team of fantastic players and to come here and play a game like this, against the most offensive and most beautiful team in the world, must make us proud. We could also have won it, but we were playing against a team that has a player who is difficult to mark, who created so many problems for us.\"He is a talent that is born every 50 years. I had never seen him live, and today he impressed me.\"- EndsPublished",

The leg-spinner said that he didn\u2019t expect to feature in the first few games of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 due to his injury.After making his IPL debut in 2023, the 21-year-old Suyash stayed with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) for two seasons before RCB picked him for Rs 2.60 crore in the mega auction that took place in Jeddah last year.Suyash, who has 14 wickets to his name from 22 IPL matches, said that he once used to play with injections.\"I was very happy, absolutely happy. I knew that with RCB, I had a good chance. I had been practicing \u2014 this had been going on for two years. Until two years ago, I used to play by taking injections.

And there I had James Pipey. He and his family treated me like their own family. I had three hernias, I\u2019m telling the truth \u2014 I didn\u2019t even expect to play the first match. I was told that I should play after three or four matches because my surgery was quite major.\u201cBut James took such good care of me, better than anyone else could. I\u2019m really thankful that I came to this franchise \u2014 I became completely fit. Otherwise, I have been dealing with this issue for the past two years.

The victory extended their winning streak to six matches as they climbed to the top of the points table.Listen to StoryLive TVShareJasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya (AP Photo)Rishabh BeniwalNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 23:36 ISTIn ShortMumbai Indians scored 217/2 in 20 overs batting firstRajasthan Royals got bundled out for 117 in 16.1 oversMumbai Indians extended their winning streak to seven matchesMumbai Indians (MI) have made a roaring comeback in the Indian Premier League 2025 (IPL 2025) as they extended their winning streak to six matches with a 100-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR). The Hardik Pandya-led side played at its dominating best, crushing Rajasthan on Thursday, May 1, at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, to knock them out of the competition.The victory also helped MI end their 12-year winning drought in Jaipur, with their last victory at the venue coming way back in 2013. A hapless Rajasthan batting line-up could only score 117 in 16.1 overs chasing a massive target of 218, with Jofra Archer top scoring with 30 (27). Following their commanding victory, Mumbai climbed to the top of the points table with seven wins from 11 matches, having 14 points to their name.On the other hand, Rajasthan maintained eighth spot, with three wins from ten matches, having six points. It has been a remarkable comeback for Mumbai, who won just one out of the first five matches.A ruthless bowling displayDefending a massive score, the potent bowling attack of Mumbai was hungry to pounce on Rajasthan. The carnage with the ball began on just the fourth delivery as last game\u2019s heroVaibhav Suryavanshi, got a reality check in life, getting dismissed for a two-ball duckby Deepak Chahar.Suryavanshi\u2019s early departure had little effect on his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit Trent Boult for two maximums. However, it was the left-arm seamer who had the last laugh by dismantling his stumps on 13 (6).IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesWith both openers back in the pavilion, captain Riyan Parag walked to the crease and played a few shots to keep the required run rate in check. However, there was no stopping Trent Boult (3/28), who further got Nitish Rana holed out to deep square leg as the RR batter couldn\u2019t make the most of his drop catch in the previous over.After Rana\u2019s dismissal, Rajasthan were reduced to 41/3 in four overs, but their worst was yet to come as MI skipper unleashed a hungry Jasprit Bumrah (2/15) on them. The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai\u2019s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.At the other end,Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 ballsas the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn\u2019t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn\u2019t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai\u2019s innings.Meanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the other hand, Rajasthan will look to salvage some pride in their remaining matches as they lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 4 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Gill suffered back spasm during the team's previous match vs Rajasthan Royals.Listen to StoryLive TVShareShubman Gill trains before match vs SRH. (PTI Photo)India Today Sports DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 22:30 ISTIn ShortGujarat face Hyderabad in their 10th match of IPL 2025GT have performed strongly this seasonGill suffered a back spasm vs RRGujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill is likely to play against SunRisers Hyderabad despite suffering a back issue in the last game. Gill could not field against Rajasthan Royals in GT's last match after suffering a back spasm on April 28, Monday.Gujarat have done well in the IPL this season and have 12 points from 9 matches. They have consistently been in the top 2 positions in the league table and would not like to lose their momentum in the final stage of the tournament.Gujarat Titans' director of cricket Vikram Solanki confirmed the issue in the pre-match press conference and said that it was a precautionary move to take Shubman off the field against Rajasthan, and that it was likely that the skipper would be taking the field against SRH.GT got hammered by Rajasthan in their previous game,with 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi taking the attack to the opposition. Vaibhav scored a 35-ball hundred, the second fastest in IPL history, to hand GT their first defeat in 3 matches.\u201cHis fitness, there was a bit of a back spasm. We\u2019re just trying to be careful with it. He'll be at training today. We'll just see where he's at. We're reasonably confident that he's going to be OK,\u201d said Solanki on the eve of GT\u2019s game against SRH in Ahmedabad.Solanki insisted that Suryavanshi\u2019s bruising 35-ball 100 has not heaped any extra pressure on his side.\u201cFirstly, I don't think the team has been decimated or anything of the sort. We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match. All eyes will be on SRH batters vs Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna \u2014 two pacers who have been on song this season.- EndsPublished",

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar.

It is played in both singles and doubles format using a paddle and a perforated hollow plastic ball volleyed across a court that is the same size as a doubles' badminton court with a slightly low-placed net.\"This is a defining moment, but we see it as just the beginning. Our focus is firmly on the future, building a pipeline of talent, creating career opportunities, and ensuring every Indian has access to the joy and benefits of pickleball,\" IPA President Suryaveer Singh Bhullar posted on Instagram.AIPA QUESTIONS GOVERNMENT 'S DECISIONThe AIPA issued a statement questioning the ministry's move, claiming it to be the \"pioneering body responsible for introducing and nurturing Pickleball in India since 2007\u201308.\"\"This decision is not only disheartening but raises serious concerns regarding transparency and fairness in sports governance. In the interest of fair play and sportsmanship, we urge the Ministry to reconsider its decision and uphold the values of clean sports,\" AIPA President Arvind Prabhoo stated.The AIPA cited a clause in the 2011 National Sports Code which mandates that for a body to be considered a National Sports Federation, it should have \"actively existed for more than three years on the date of application for recognition.\"The IPA was registered in November last year as per the records of the Registrar of Companies, while the AIPA had completed this formality back in 2008.The AIPA statement alleged that the Ministry's move appears to have been influenced by \"undue lobbying and misleading representations made by the newly formed entity.\"\"The AIPA gave a representation to the Sports Ministry on October 18 last year. But the Ministry has decided to grant recognition to a four-month old company that has no organisational set-up, no district level presence like us,\" AIPA Treasurer Nikhil Mathare told PTI.\"Given the exemptions that have been made for AIPA, we are left with no choice but to take legal recourse. But we will have a conversation with the ministry before we proceed with it,\" he added.Pickleball's global administration has also witnessed a fair number of tug of wars over the years. There are three bodies that claim to be global governing bodies of the sport.The International Pickleball Federation (IPF), the World Pickleball Federation (WPF) and the Global Pickleball Federation (GPF). The IPF came into existence in 2010, followed by the WPF in 2018, while the GPF was founded in 2023 after the USA broke ranks with the IPF- EndsPublished",

The victory extended their winning streak to six matches as they climbed to the top of the points table.Listen to StoryLive TVShareJasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya (AP Photo)Rishabh BeniwalNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 23:36 ISTIn ShortMumbai Indians scored 217/2 in 20 overs batting firstRajasthan Royals got bundled out for 117 in 16.1 oversMumbai Indians extended their winning streak to seven matchesMumbai Indians (MI) have made a roaring comeback in the Indian Premier League 2025 (IPL 2025) as they extended their winning streak to six matches with a 100-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR). The Hardik Pandya-led side played at its dominating best, crushing Rajasthan on Thursday, May 1, at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, to knock them out of the competition.The victory also helped MI end their 12-year winning drought in Jaipur, with their last victory at the venue coming way back in 2013. A hapless Rajasthan batting line-up could only score 117 in 16.1 overs chasing a massive target of 218, with Jofra Archer top scoring with 30 (27). Following their commanding victory, Mumbai climbed to the top of the points table with seven wins from 11 matches, having 14 points to their name.On the other hand, Rajasthan maintained eighth spot, with three wins from ten matches, having six points. It has been a remarkable comeback for Mumbai, who won just one out of the first five matches.A ruthless bowling displayDefending a massive score, the potent bowling attack of Mumbai was hungry to pounce on Rajasthan. The carnage with the ball began on just the fourth delivery as last game\u2019s heroVaibhav Suryavanshi, got a reality check in life, getting dismissed for a two-ball duckby Deepak Chahar.Suryavanshi\u2019s early departure had little effect on his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit Trent Boult for two maximums. However, it was the left-arm seamer who had the last laugh by dismantling his stumps on 13 (6).IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesWith both openers back in the pavilion, captain Riyan Parag walked to the crease and played a few shots to keep the required run rate in check. However, there was no stopping Trent Boult (3/28), who further got Nitish Rana holed out to deep square leg as the RR batter couldn\u2019t make the most of his drop catch in the previous over.After Rana\u2019s dismissal, Rajasthan were reduced to 41/3 in four overs, but their worst was yet to come as MI skipper unleashed a hungry Jasprit Bumrah (2/15) on them. The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai\u2019s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.At the other end,Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 ballsas the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn\u2019t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn\u2019t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai\u2019s innings.Meanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the other hand, Rajasthan will look to salvage some pride in their remaining matches as they lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 4 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!

Vaibhav scored a 35-ball hundred, the second fastest in IPL history, to hand GT their first defeat in 3 matches.\u201cHis fitness, there was a bit of a back spasm. We\u2019re just trying to be careful with it. He'll be at training today. We'll just see where he's at. We're reasonably confident that he's going to be OK,\u201d said Solanki on the eve of GT\u2019s game against SRH in Ahmedabad.Solanki insisted that Suryavanshi\u2019s bruising 35-ball 100 has not heaped any extra pressure on his side.\u201cFirstly, I don't think the team has been decimated or anything of the sort. We mustn't take any credit away from that young man. He played quite brilliantly,\u201d he said.The former England batter said they could have planned better against the 14-year-old RR batter when he was on a rampage.\u201cOf course, we could have done things differently. We could have bowled in a slightly more controlling manner, we could have sort of shut him down perhaps,\u201d he added.GT are up against SRH, who need to win all their matches to directly qualify for the IPL playoffs. SRH remained in the hunt by stuttering to a victory against Chennai Super Kings in their previous match.\u201cWe must pay the due respect that SRH deserves. They are a very strong team. We will be conscious of the threat that they have. They've got match-winners across their team,\" Vikram Solanki said.SRH had taken a mini-vacation in the Maldives in their week-long break before this match. All eyes will be on SRH batters vs Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna \u2014 two pacers who have been on song this season.- EndsPublished",

Just three days after becoming the youngest player in Twenty20 history to score a hundred, the 14-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck. Vaibhav failed to trouble the scorers in Rajasthan Royals' IPL 2025 home game against Mumbai Indians in Jaipur on Thursday, 1 May. |RR vs MI Scorecard|The teenager stood at the crease, visibly disappointed and unsure how he had failed to clear the mid-on fielder in the very first over of Rajasthan's chase of 218 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. The Jaipur crowd, which had roared in delight as Vaibhav took strike, fell silent as the youngster trudged back to the pavilion.Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the toast of the cricketing world when he hit 101 from just 38 balls in just his third IPL game. The 14-year-old came up with a beyond-believable big-hitting display, smashing 11 sixes and seven boundaries in Jaipur, helping Rajasthan chase 210 in just 15.5 overs.However, on Thursday, Vaibhav was not able to get under a fuller-length delivery from Deepak Chahar, who opened the bowling for Mumbai in their defence of 219. Vaibhav dug out a yorker in the first delivery he faced, but was unable to hit the next one over the mid-on fielder. MI kept the mid-on fielder inside the 30-yard circle and Will Jacks made no mistake, catching the ball and sending the young man back.Vaibhav spent a couple of seconds in the middle, unable to process the disappointment before he walked back. It was the first single-digit score for Vaibhav in IPL 2025. Rajasthan head coach Rahul Dravid was as dejected as the rest of those in pink in Jaipur, seeing Vaibhav fail to trouble the scorers. Only on Wednesday,Dravid had spokenabout the need for Vaibhav to handle the highs and lows of cricket without letting emotions take control in his teenage days.Vaibhav also became the sixth batter in IPL history to get out for a duck in the innings that followed a hundred.BATTERS WITH DUCKS AFTER HUNDRED IN IPLYusuf Pathan (2010)Suresh Raina (2013)Venkatesh Iyer (2023)Marcus Stoinis (2024)Ishan Kishan (2025)Vaibhav Suryavanshi (2025)Vaibhav, 14, is a prodigiously talented cricketer from Bihar. He became the youngest man to secure an IPL contract when he was bought for Rs 1.1 crore by Rajasthan Royals in the mega auction last year when he was still 13.Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his first-class debut for Bihar in January 2024 at just 12 years and 284 days old. In his debut outing, he scored 71 off 42 balls against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, becoming the youngest Indian to hit a List-A fifty. On the international stage, he smashed a 58-ball century against Australia in Chennai, setting the record for the fastest youth Test hundred by an Indian, and played a key role in India\u2019s run to the ACC U19 Asia Cup final with two vital half-centuries.- EndsPublished",

The victory extended their winning streak to six matches as they climbed to the top of the points table.Listen to StoryLive TVShareJasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya (AP Photo)Rishabh BeniwalNew Delhi,UPDATED:May 1, 2025 23:36 ISTIn ShortMumbai Indians scored 217/2 in 20 overs batting firstRajasthan Royals got bundled out for 117 in 16.1 oversMumbai Indians extended their winning streak to seven matchesMumbai Indians (MI) have made a roaring comeback in the Indian Premier League 2025 (IPL 2025) as they extended their winning streak to six matches with a 100-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR). The Hardik Pandya-led side played at its dominating best, crushing Rajasthan on Thursday, May 1, at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, to knock them out of the competition.The victory also helped MI end their 12-year winning drought in Jaipur, with their last victory at the venue coming way back in 2013. A hapless Rajasthan batting line-up could only score 117 in 16.1 overs chasing a massive target of 218, with Jofra Archer top scoring with 30 (27). Following their commanding victory, Mumbai climbed to the top of the points table with seven wins from 11 matches, having 14 points to their name.On the other hand, Rajasthan maintained eighth spot, with three wins from ten matches, having six points. It has been a remarkable comeback for Mumbai, who won just one out of the first five matches.A ruthless bowling displayDefending a massive score, the potent bowling attack of Mumbai was hungry to pounce on Rajasthan. The carnage with the ball began on just the fourth delivery as last game\u2019s heroVaibhav Suryavanshi, got a reality check in life, getting dismissed for a two-ball duckby Deepak Chahar.Suryavanshi\u2019s early departure had little effect on his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal, who hit Trent Boult for two maximums. However, it was the left-arm seamer who had the last laugh by dismantling his stumps on 13 (6).IPL 2025: RR vs MI UpdatesWith both openers back in the pavilion, captain Riyan Parag walked to the crease and played a few shots to keep the required run rate in check. However, there was no stopping Trent Boult (3/28), who further got Nitish Rana holed out to deep square leg as the RR batter couldn\u2019t make the most of his drop catch in the previous over.After Rana\u2019s dismissal, Rajasthan were reduced to 41/3 in four overs, but their worst was yet to come as MI skipper unleashed a hungry Jasprit Bumrah (2/15) on them. The speedster immediately made an impact by bouncing out Parag (16 off 8) and Shimron Hetmyer (0 off 10) in his first over itself.As a result, MI became the first team this season to take five wickets inside the powerplay. There was no comeback for RR following a searing new-ball spell as Pandya (1/2) and Karn Sharma (3/23) also joined the party as Rajasthan capitulated against an all-round MI attack.Rohit, Rickelton give solid foundationThe foundation for Mumbai\u2019s win was laid through a 116-run opening stand off 71 balls between Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, after MI were put in to bat first by RR captain Riyan Parag. The duo was circumspect against the new ball and scored their first boundary on the tenth ball of the innings as Rohit Sharma broke the shackles.At the other end, Ryan Rickelton also got a move on by targeting Fazalhaq Farooqui and Jofra Archer. The duo brought up their fifty-run stand off 32 balls and finished the powerplay on 58/0. Rickelton brought up his half century off 29 balls with a massive six against Kumar Kartikeya.At the other end,Rohit also brought up his third half-century of the season off 31 ballsas the duo registered their maiden century partnership off 61 balls. Rajasthan finally managed to break a massive partnership as Rickelton (61 off 38) and Rohit Sharma (53 off 36) got dismissed in successive overs, falling prey to Maheesh Theekshana (1/47) and Riyan Parag (1/12) respectively.Hardik, Suryakumar's fiery finishLittle did RR know, there was more misery waiting for them as Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav got together at the crease. Suryakumar made his intentions clear as he got off the mark with a boundary. Pandya also didn\u2019t take much time to get into the groove as he also got off the mark with a cracking four against Farooqui.With a belter of a track to bat on, the duo unleashed their beast mode on RR in no time and didn\u2019t even spare Archer. Suryakumar (48* off 23) put his 360-degree strokeplay on display, sending the ball to all corners of the ground. On the other hand, Pandya (48* off 23) continued to send the ball towards the boundary with his brute force. The duo forged an unbeaten 94-run stand off just 44 balls, giving a strong finish to Mumbai\u2019s innings.Meanwhile, being at the top of their form, MI will next take on the high-flying Gujarat Titans (GT) on May 6 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. On the other hand, Rajasthan will look to salvage some pride in their remaining matches as they lock horns with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on May 4 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Stay updated onIPL 2025with India Today!
